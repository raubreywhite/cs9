# sc 8.0.2

- Allows for multiple databases to be used for different access levels.
- copy_into_new_table_where now also copies indexes.
- V8 schemas now have a nice print function.
- V8 redirects now have a nice print function.
- copy_into_new_table_where uses tablock.
- upsert_at_end_of_each_plan and insert_at_end_of_each_plan can now take named lists as the return value from the action_fn.
- Custom progressr handler.

# sc 8.0.1

- When using `sc8::add_task_from_config_v8` the schema list is checked to make sure they are actually schemas. This will solve the issue where people incorrectly add non-existent schemas to the task.
- insert_data, upsert_data, drop_all_rows_and_then_insert_data are now the recommended ways of inserting data
- addin_load_production
- schemas now use load_folder_fn, which should dynamically check if a user has permission to write to a folder, solving permissions errors
- Including tm_get_schema_names
- Both granularity_time AND granularity_geo are now included in db censors
- Requires R >= 4.1.0
- sc8::config\u0026plan_attempt_index now exists. When running plans in parallel, if a plan fails it is retried five times. This lets a user track which attempt they are on. This is mostly useful so that emails and smses are only sent when  sc8::config$plan_attempt_index==1
- (Disabled) TABLOCK is disabled right now due to issues where data would not be uploaded.
- (Disabled) Data is sorted before sending it to bcp to speed up in/upserts.
